= Monitor Redpanda Cloud
:description: Learn how to integrate the Redpanda Cloud metrics endpoint to monitor the health of your Dedicated or BYOC clusters.
:page-cloud: true
:env-cloud: true

You can configure monitoring on your Redpanda Dedicated or BYOC cluster to maintain system health and optimize performance. Redpanda exports metrics from the xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc[`/public_metrics`] Prometheus endpoint through the Admin API port 9644. 

== Configure monitoring

You can monitor Redpanda with Prometheus or with any other monitoring and alerting tool, such as Datadog, New Relic, Elastic Cloud, Google, or Azure.

[NOTE]
====
To maximize performance, Redpanda exports some metrics only when the underlying feature is in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups, xref:reference:public-metrics-reference.adoc#redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset[`redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset`], is only exported when groups are registered.

=== Configure Prometheus

To monitor a Dedicated or BYOC cluster in https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus^]:

. On the Redpanda Cloud *Overview* page for your cluster, under *How to connect*, click the *Prometheus* tab. 

. Click the copy icon for *Prometheus YAML* to copy the contents to your clipboard. 
+

+
The YAML contains the Prometheus scrape target configuration, as well as authentication, for the cluster.
+
```
- job_name: redpandaCloud-sample
  static_configs:
    - targets:
        - console-321f60a4.cn6b1srsj6j1mdqdhil0.fmc.ppd.cloud.redpanda.com
  metrics_path: /api/cloud/prometheus/public_metrics
  basic_auth:
    username: prometheus
    password: "%kvjQr^E!xQ+lXqJ~g?5HhZ3"
  scheme: https
```

. Save this information to Prometheus, and observe in Prometheus that metrics from Redpanda endpoints are scraped.

TIP: For a sample Docker Compose file that brings up Prometheus and Grafana, see https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/tree/main/cloud[Redpanda monitoring examples repository^].

=== Configure Datadog

To monitor a Dedicated or BYOC cluster in https://www.datadoghq.com/[Datadog]:

. On the Redpanda Cloud *Overview* page for your cluster, under *How to connect*, click the *Prometheus* tab. 

. Click the copy icon for *Prometheus YAML* to find scrape target configuration, as well as authentication, for the cluster.

. In Datadog, define the `openmetrics_endpoint` URL for that monitored cluster. The integration configuration should look similar to the following:
+
```
instances:
  # The endpoint to collect metrics about Polaris. Replace ORGANIZATION_NAME with the name of your organization.
  - openmetrics_endpoint: https://console/-<id>.<identifier>.fmc.cloud.redpanda.com/api/cloud/prometheus/public_metrics
    use_openmetrics: true
    collect_counters_with_distributions: true

    auth_type: basic
    username: prom_user
    password: prom_pass
```

NOTE: Integration requires the Datadog agent. The agent must be run in a container in your own container infrastructure. Redpanda does not support launching this container inside a Dedicated or BYOC Kubernetes cluster. For more inforamtion, see the https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/redpanda/?tab=host[Datadoc documentation] and https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/tree/master/redpanda[Redpanda Datadog integration]
